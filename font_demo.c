// * Bit image table. The bit image of the glyphs in the font. The glyph images of every defined glyph in the font are placed sequentially in order of increasing ASCII code. The bit image is one pixel image with no undefined stretches that has a height given by the value of the font rectangle element and a width given by the value of the bit image row width element. The image is padded at the end with extra pixels to make its length a multiple of 16.
// * Bitmap location table. For every glyph in the font, this table contains a word that specifies the bit offset to the location of the bitmap for that glyph in the bit image table. If a glyph is missing from the font, its entry contains the same value for its location as the entry for the next glyph. The missing glyph is the last glyph of the bit image for that font. The last word of the table contains the offset to one bit beyond the end of the bit image. You can determine the image width of each glyph from the bitmap location table by subtracting the bit offset to that glyph from the bit offset to the next glyph in the table.
// * Width/offset table. For every glyph in the font, this table contains a word with the glyph offset in the high-order byte and the glyph's width, in integer form, in the low-order byte. The value of the offset, when added to the maximum kerning value for the font, determines the horizontal distance from the glyph origin to the left edge of the bit image of the glyph, in pixels. If this sum is negative, the glyph origin is to the right of the glyph image's left edge, meaning the glyph kerns to the left. If the sum is positive, the origin is to the left of the image's left edge. If the sum equals zero, the glyph origin corresponds with the left edge of the bit image. Missing glyphs are represented by a word value of -1. The last word of this table is also -1, representing the end.
